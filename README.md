# MarvelPJGuide
The MarvelPJGuide app allows the user to navigate through all the characters from MarvelÂ´s universe, and see every detail of their favourite characters.

The code is build around the **M****V****P** Architecture Pattern. 
Each scene has their own a storyboard which is control by a Viewcontroller(UI), a Presenter(Logic) and a Model(Data). At the same time almost all the scenes have their UI components grouped in custom Views, which can be located in /Common/Views or inside their own scene folder, depending on the places it is used in the app.

Remember to put your API Key into the info.plist, to have the app ready.
